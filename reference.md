## Glossary

Mutational Genomics
:	an experimental process that combines mutagenesis and genomics tools to help us discern the functions of genes.

Fastq
:	a text-based sequence file format that incorporates sequence and quality scores, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format)

ASCII
:	An acronym from American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Does things like describe letter characters as numbers that the computer can understand and provides the basis of the Fastq quality encoding [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart)

Phred
:	A score that describes the likelihood of error in a single base call from a sequencing machine [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score)

FastQC
:	A useful and widely used sequence quality assessment program [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

Encoding
:	A confusion in exactly what symbol represents what number in Phred quality scores [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding)

Trimmomatic
:	[http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)

Kmer
:	A sequence of length `k`. Often used to describe the population of all `k`-length sub-sequences of a larger sequence or sequence set, such as a set of reads.

Whole Genome Shotgun
:	A sequencing method whereby the chromosomes are shattered into fragments and each sequenced individually.
